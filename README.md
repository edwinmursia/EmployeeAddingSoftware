# EmployeeAddingSoftware

## About the software:
This is a browser software where the end user can input information of a new employee and add the employee to a database. The database stores every employee that has been added through the browser software. The salary of the new employee can be changed and the employee can also be removed from the database. This is how it works:

#### 1. Adding all the information of the new employee:
